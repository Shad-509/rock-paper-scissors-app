You create a variable with the keyword let , const , or var followed by the name of your variable.
querySelectorAll is a method that returns a list of the elements that match a specified CSS selector(s) in the document.
forEach is a method that executes a provided function once for each array element.

forEach also takes a callback function as an argument.
The callback function is executed for each element in the array.
The call back function is passed on three arguments.
The first argument is the current element being processed.
The second argument is the index of the current element being processed.
The third argument is the array object.
The callback function can be used to update the score.
choices is a variable that contains the choices of the player and computer.
textContent is a property that sets or returns the text content of the specified node.
const stands for constant. It is used to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned.
Let and var can be reassigned.
Without using the querySelectorAll method, we would not be able to create our forEach loop because querySelectorAll returns a list of the elements in the document that match a specified CSS selector(s) such as #rock, #paper, #scissors this is why we need to use the querySelectorAll method because it returns a list of elements that we can use in our forEach loop to iterate through the list of elements. A callback function is a function inside the parentheses of another function and example in our code is the function choice inside the forEach method. The list of elements being used are the choices of the player and computer. We can use the forEach method to iterate through the list of elements. We pass the callback function to the forEach method. The callback function is executed for each element in the array.
